# CafeMenu-ColoredMarkers-RegistrationForm
A set of very simple HTML &amp; CSS nano-projects: a Café Menu for practicing text layout, Colored Markers for working with colors and the box model, and a Registration Form for basic form structure and styling. Together they build core beginner web-development skills.
